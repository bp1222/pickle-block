    "description": "The Pickle block will [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) the contents of a nio Signal.  This block will typically be used before a publisher block, combined with the Unpickle block after a subscriber block.  This is due to the fact that the communications system of nio does not allow strictly pythonic data types for transmission.  It only allows JSON-able data types.  So sending tuples, bytestrings, and objects is not possible. If your service is to communicate strictly to another nio Binary running in python, this is a good shorthand to ensure you can submit your python data directly to the other side while preserving the data types.",
